A quote from [Typographic Web Design](http://www.typographicwebdesign.com/)

    THIS IS A WEBPAGE

    Crossroads of civilization.
    Refuge of all arts against the ravange of time.
    Armory of fearless truth against whispering rumor.
    Incessant trumpet of trade.

    From this page, words may fly abroad,
    not to be silenced or censored by limitations of space or access.
    Not to withhold ideas and information from those who seek them,
    but to serve as a connection
    from the write's hand to the readers' minds.
    Friend, you share a sacred space.
